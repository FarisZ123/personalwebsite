And to show it, I attached a few things below to prove my affection for you! \n\n You literally are the one thing I look forward to everyday. When I have a good day, I wanna run to you and tell you all about it. It gets to a point where I end up just blabbing on about everything and later on when we wanna talk some more, I end up having nothing to say bcuz I said it all ðŸ˜­. And when I have a bad day, youâ€™re the one person I look for comfort in. You bring me up when I feel down, you give confidence in my looks and most importantly, you remind me that love can come from the most unexpected places sometimes, so I should never give up especially when things look grim.
