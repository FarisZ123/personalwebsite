        <h2>Hi Sayang,</h2>
        <p>
          Let me start off by saying that these past few days with you have
          completely changed how I view life. You gave me hope at a time when
          everything just seems to drain the life out of me. From school to
          finding a job, nothing has kept me going quite like you. It's crazy
          because if you asked me even a couple of months ago, I would've never
          thought I'd see the day I could call you mine :) It still feels
          extraordinary to me right now BAHAHAHA. It seems really selfish but I
          want you to know that I will do whatever it takes to keep you here
          with me. I get really jealous easily (if you couldn't already tell) so
          whenever you have a problem, or you wanna rant or just talk to
          someone, I wanna be the first one that comes to your mind. Idc how
          long it takes me to get to that point, but I will leave my mark on you
          MUAHAHAHA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways I don't wanna leave too long of a message especially
          considering this letter itself isn't my best work imma be so honest
          ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. I promise I'll make up for it in the next project! But I really
          wanted to make you something for National GF's day because in my eyes,
          you deserve the world Melissa. And I wanna give you all that I have
          for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Happy National Girlfriend Day. ðŸ’•
          <br />
          The Love of Your Life,
